# BTKSAGestureMod
BTK Standalone: Gesture Mod is a small mod to allow you to switch the ActionMenu button binds back into the Gesture Lock, like how it worked originally on the Index controllers.

The mod has 2 settings that are controlled via [UIExpanionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods), by default neither right or left are overriden, you can choose either, one, both, or none by setting them in UIExpanionKit.

If you encounter issues with this mod, feel free to contact me on Discord (DDAkebono#0001)!

## Install/Usage
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) version 0.2.6 or higher, it does require 0.2.6 as it has migrated to the new MelonPrefs and MelonLogger classes.

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/ddakebono/BTKSAGestureMod/releases) and place in your VRChat\Mods folder.

The mod will initially only be fixing the nameplate position, but you can enable the hidden custom nameplate feature in the UIExpanionKit settings menu.

## Disclamer
**Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!
